## Usage

* Activate Plugin
* Select 'Description' from your Post Type menu (your post type must be public).

## About

Adds the ability to manage content at the top of your post type archive. For example, if you have a books post type and therefore a services archive (archive-books.php) then above the list of books you may want to add some information about books in general.
